    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // Prediction: 100, 100

    console.log(age, age2); // Prediction: 200, 200 -- actually: 200, 100!
    //>>>>>> If you change the original, the second variable doesn't update. That means it's not being set equal to the first variable but rather it's being set equal to the **value** of the first variable.

    // Let's say we have an array
    const playersA = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const playersB = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = playersA;
    console.log(playersA, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(playersA, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //>>>>>> In this case, the new assignment did update the original array. That means you can't reference the array and update the new one. What you have to do instead is slice the original array into the new variable.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    

    // one way
    const team2 = playersB.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(playersB, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(playersB);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(playersB, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...playersB];
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(playersB, team4);

    // or with the Array object
    const team5 = Array.from(playersB);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(playersB, team5);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const personA = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const personB = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    console.log(personA);
    const captain = personA;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(personA, captain);
    //>>>>>> This doesn't work because the second variable references the same object as the first so the object changes.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, personB, { age: 99 });
    console.log(personB, cap2);    
    //>>>>>> This works because we created a copy of the first object as a new object.

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //>>>>>> One level deep means that if we had a subproperty of the object, changing that on the new object would change it on the old object also.

    const dan = {
      name: 'Dan',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@dnlgmb',
        website: 'rocketree.com'
      }
    };

    console.log(dan);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, dan);

    //>>>>> Playing with this last iteration on the console, we can see that if we change age, only the object we changed changes. But if we change something inside social, they will both change. I'm not sure exactly why yet but I suspect it's because the social reference is an object itself that both variables are referencing (i.e. you would have to make a nested copy of the social object).
